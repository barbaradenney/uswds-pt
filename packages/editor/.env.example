# ==============================================================================
# USWDS-PT Editor (Frontend) — Environment Variables
# ==============================================================================
# Copy this file to .env and fill in the values for your environment.
# All variables must be prefixed with VITE_ to be exposed to the browser.
# Lines prefixed with # are commented out and show their default values.

# ==============================================================================
# OPTIONAL: Backend Connection
# ==============================================================================

# URL of the USWDS-PT API server.
# When set, the editor connects to the API for authentication, saving, and
# loading prototypes. All API calls (auth, prototypes, teams, symbols) use
# this as the base URL.
#
# When NOT set (empty or omitted), the editor runs in DEMO MODE:
#   - No login/registration required
#   - Prototypes are not persisted to a server
#   - Teams, organizations, and collaboration features are unavailable
#   - Crash recovery via IndexedDB still works locally
#
# Default: (empty — demo mode)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

# ==============================================================================
# OPTIONAL: AI Copilot
# ==============================================================================
# The AI Copilot adds a panel in the editor where users can describe what they
# want to build in natural language, and the AI generates USWDS HTML.
# AI SDK calls are proxied through the API server (POST /api/ai/chat) so API
# keys are never exposed in the browser bundle.
# When disabled, the copilot panel is simply hidden and the editor works
# normally without it.

# Set to "true" to enable the AI Copilot UI.
# The API server must also have AI_API_KEY configured in its .env file.
# VITE_AI_ENABLED=true

# Optional secret to gate AI access via URL parameter.
# When set, the AI Copilot is only activated if the user visits with
# ?ai=<secret> in the URL. The activation persists for the browser session
# (via sessionStorage). Users can explicitly disable with ?ai=off.
# When NOT set, the AI Copilot is available to everyone (assuming
# VITE_AI_ENABLED=true above).
# VITE_AI_SECRET=
